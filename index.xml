      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Etienne Jacob from France, born in 1994. I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer from Ecole des Ponts / MVA (I have studied computer science, applied maths and data science). I&amp;rsquo;m also an artist and make gifs with programming (and creative coding in general) on my free time.

      <description>Twitter : The place where I&amp;rsquo;m most active, there you can find more works and process behind them. Maybe not the best place to follow me if you just want best finished works.
  Instagram : Just if you like using Instagram. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of traffic there but it&amp;rsquo;s not really well suited for gif art.

      <title>Loop from periodic function and offset (Processing)</title>

      <description>This tutorial is about explaining a quite general method to make animations that loop perfectly.
You basically need 3 things :
 A periodic function (1-periodic) What to do with the periodic function An offset function  All objects have the same periodic motion or change but with an offset, which can give patterns and a feeling of propagation. Here the periodic function has to be 1-periodic because time goes from 0 to 1.</description>

      <description>This tutorial is about making a basic perfectly looping gif with Processing : a dot doing a circular loop.
The trajectory of the black dot has to be described with maths : the angle depends on time and the radius is fixed. Hence if the radius of the circle is r, the position at time t can be defined with :
 Note that if t goes from 0 to 1 (which will always be the case), the position at t=0 is the same as t=1.</description>

      <description>This tutorial is about a perfect loop technique that&amp;rsquo;s similar to periodic function propagation from the previous tutorial but using noise and more advanced technique. I call it &amp;ldquo;noise propagation&amp;rdquo;.
Those things are added to the previous technique :
 using noise to get a smooth periodic function using more dimensions of noise to get variation through space  The goal is to explain what&amp;rsquo;s behind an animation like this one :</description>

      <description>This is about a perfect loop technique that&amp;rsquo;s probably the one I use the most. It&amp;rsquo;s abstract and general : the idea is to have queue of objects. During the time of one gif loop, each object will take the position or state of next one. That&amp;rsquo;s why I call it the &amp;ldquo;replacement&amp;rdquo; technique.
Basically we have one function like this one :
 And to draw all objects with a perfect loop we do :</description>

      <description>What software do you use to make your animations? My animations are made by programming. Most of them have been made with Processing (Java version). I&amp;rsquo;ve also been using openFrameworks which is similar to Processing but in C++, and rarely Blender with python scripting for few gifs posted on Twitter. I also make stuff with shaders (GLSL) sometimes.
How to learn to do this? To learn to draw stuff with code, I suggest watching The Coding Train.</description>

  Rare colorful gifs
  It&amp;rsquo;s not designed for mobile so far and lightweight mp4 gallery might come when I&amp;rsquo;ll have motivation!
There are some more on my twitter account, I kind of share more of the process behind gifs there.</description>

      <description>Making a first gif with Processing Loop from periodic function and offset (Processing) Noise propagation (Processing) Replacement technique (Processing)  Note : I&amp;rsquo;m a self taught creative coder, this is about sharing tricks I find useful. There may be bad habits and things I don&amp;rsquo;t know.
Note 2 : Those tutorials are about general techniques and it can be better to avoid them to find more creative loop ideas.</description>
